    "1. The important aspects of algorithmic thinking. \n",
    "    + I've researched, learned, and reproduce four different popular searching algorithms. \n",
    "        + As I was reproducing the popular algorithms such as 'Dijkstra algorithm', 'A_star algorithm', 'Branch and Bound', and 'Hungarian algorithm', It improves my algorithmic thinking techniques and teaches me viewing the approaches in many different ways which eventually allows me to develop at least three of my owned algorithms which is a hybrid method of each of powerful searching algorithms. \n",
    "2. Each algorithms has it's own unique ways and key characteristics of pruning the search space to solve the problem. \n",
    "    + 'A_star algorithm' estimates the future value and prune the search space that is far worse than the estimated future value. This algorithm gives faster computation time than searching with no pruning with resulting the optimal solution; yet It was still slow and not satisfying my need. \n",
    "    + 'Branch and Bound' does relaxation and compare with incumbent solution to prune the search space; with same reason as 'A_star search' it was not satisfying my need. \n",
    "    + 'Hungarian algorithm' does solve the problem in polynomial time; however, It is very specialized in solving the task assignment problem; whereas, other algorithms can be used in many different application.  So I was more interested in pruning algorithm so It is more generalized algorithm that can be used in other types of problem as well. The key idea from 'Hungarian algorithm' is call 'row/column reduction' which I thought can be used to reduce the tons of search space. \n",
    "    + 'Hybrid method', after I've reproduce those algorithm and had full control of every algorithm to freely modify, delete, improve and develop and be able to combine all key idea from each algorithm to make it prunes more search space to reduce the computation time without losing the optimal solution.  That's how I've came up with this method.   "
